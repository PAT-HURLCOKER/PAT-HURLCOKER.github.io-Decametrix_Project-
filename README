The Cleaning_Data notebook works on cleaning most of the LDP EOP Data and LOI datasets. 
After the data was cleaned, other project members used the new, cleaned datasets to perform analysis:

-Linear Regression

-Seeing if Course Objectives were being met

-Analyzing the consistency of the responses to Faculty rating questions
