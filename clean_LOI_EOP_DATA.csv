While the feedback to me was quite affirmative, the way she gave constructive feedback to others was educational.  She took their behaviors, made factual observations of them to maintain neutrality, and used those observations to draw out the impact and need for modifications.  This is an area where I am going to work to adopt some of those great practices.","While I agreed with everything Nancy said about each member, I did note and hear from others the observation that she was one-sided in the feedback she provided to some individuals.  While I don't believe in empty feedback (nor empty/feint praise) I believe Nancy could improve her feedback by incorporating some positives for those who have a lot of ""negatives"" they need to work on, and some ""negatives"" for those who had a lot of positives.

I think continue to offer guidance in the level that should participate in the session.    I was happy with the folks in my CCL experience but if it was a lot of junior colleagues it would have been disappointing.   That was not my experience, I found it to be an appropriate leadership level which I was encouraged by.  

Just a couple comments socially.   Our group really connected but I think there is still more opportunity to possibly connect people more.   On Monday somehow more time to get the large group in a social activity or an evening activity.   I know we all have homework but I really only felt super connected to my division and then a couple others until the week progressed.   A lot of this was due to our Looking Glass sim didn't spend any time cross functionally on the 1st day of the simulation.       Perhaps also circulating the contact list earlier would have made it easier for those of us at the hotel to connect for dinner.   Just an idea.   

More of a housekeeping but something with my information seemed dated.   I could have very easily gone to the wrong location as my materials gave me a different location and referred to the 11th floor.   I think that is an old location  for CCL.   I definitely got that from my portal it wasn't something I pulled from on the web.   Also, in two places the materials differ on how you describe the dress.   One said ""casual"" and comfortable and then elsewhere it said ""business casual"" and that seems like two different recommendations.

I would also have appreciated a less theoretical approach (leadership frameworks / checklists) and more examples, mini cases studies, and hands-on role playing where you truly practice the 13 competencies in the context of mini-simulations.

I felt like you were giving me an SBI about an emotion and not a behavior. Emotional feedback (particularly the easy trap of happiness) is difficult to modulate.
